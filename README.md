=====

 A light weight workflow manager for scientific computing at scale that:

- executes [CWL](http://www.commonwl.org) workflows

- is a cloud native workflow platform designed from the ground up to be fast, scalable and fault tolerant

- supports [CWLProv](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwlprov)

- is RESTful. The [API](./API/) is accessible from desktops, HPC systems, exotic hardware, the cloud and your smartphone

- is designed for complex scientific computing and supports computing on multiple platforms with zero setup

- supports containerized environments with Docker and Singularity

- is part of our reproducible science platform [Skyport](https://github.com/MG-RAST/Skyport2) combined to create [Researchobjects](http://www.researchobject.org/) when combined with [CWL](http://www.commonwl.org) and [CWLProv](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwlprov)
