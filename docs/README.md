![AWE](images/awe-lg.png)


 A light weight workflow manager for scientific computing at scale that:

- executes [CWL](http://www.commonwl.org) workflows

- is a cloud native workflow platform designed from the ground up to be fast, scalable and fault tolerant

- supports [CWLProv](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwlprov)

- is RESTful. The [API](./API/) is accessible from desktops, HPC systems, exotic hardware, the cloud and your smartphone

- is designed for complex scientific computing and supports computing on multiple platforms with zero setup

- supports containerized environments with Docker and Singularity

- is part of our reproducible science platform [Skyport](https://github.com/MG-RAST/Skyport2) combined to create [Researchobjects](http://www.researchobject.org/) when combined with [CWL](http://www.commonwl.org) and [CWLProv](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwlprov)

AWE is actively being developed at [github.com/MG-RAST/AWE](https://github.com/MG-RAST/AWE).


You can use AWE simultaenously on Clouds, Clusters and HPC systems with dozens, hundreds or thousands of nodes to run tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of individuals workflows. 


## AWE Quickstart
This assumes that you have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed and `curl` is available locally.

### Start AWE services

```bash
source ./init.sh
docker-compose up
```
This will start AWE server, one AWE worker, Shock object store and corresponding MongoDB containers.
Don't forget to later `docker-compose down` and do not forget, by default this demo configuration does not store data persistently.


### Submit a job for simple workflow

This example consists of CWL workflow that takes a PDF file as input, extracts all words and generates a visual wordcloud. Execute the followin command in a new terminal from within the AWE folder:

```bash
 ./awe_submit.sh -w test/tests/pdf2wordcloud.cwl -j test/tests/rules-of-acquisition.job.cwl -d tmp
```
